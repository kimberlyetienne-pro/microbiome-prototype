# Tiny Health – Microbiome Insight Demo

A simple front-end prototype exploring how microbiome markers can be translated into a clean, user-friendly insight view.

This demo includes:
- A short landing → results flow
- An adult gut profile summary
- Marker statuses with gentle explanations
- High-level insights and supportive next steps
- Lightweight HTML/CSS/JS structure (no build tools)

This is a conceptual demo only — not a representation of Tiny Health’s actual science or UI.  
Built to explore product thinking, UX clarity, and microbiome-inspired logic.

## Running locally
